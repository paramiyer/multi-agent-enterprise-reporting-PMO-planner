# Complex PMO Visualization with Multi-Agent AI Planning

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a multi-agent AI-based orchestration system to generate enterprise-level KPI dashboard delivery scenarios.

## Project Overview
The notebook uses a structured prompt-based multi-agent setup to estimate and plan:
- KPI definition and stakeholder analysis
- UX design planning
- Dashboard development
- Data engineering and ETL design
- QA and UAT effort estimation
- Final deployment and user training
- Consolidation of all efforts into 4 delivery scenarios (A, B, C1, C2)

## Features
- Uses GPT agents to simulate tech leads from each function
- Each agent outputs scoped estimates and timelines
- A `resource_estimator_agent` aggregates the results and creates optimized delivery scenarios
- External validation checks ensure cost/duration sanity

## Running the Notebook
This notebook assumes access to OpenAI's GPT models and a prompt-based planning structure. Ensure the following:
- API access with relevant cost structures configured
- YAML task and agent specifications for grounding
- All domain agent prompts and validation logic set up in the notebook

## Output Examples
- Scenario tables with cost and timelines
- Gantt charts in Markdown
- Function-level validation scores and critique summaries

## Future Improvements
- Integrate historical cost benchmarking
- Add domain-specific dataset for better estimates
- Convert into a Streamlit Copilot or Copilot Plugin
