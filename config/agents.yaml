resource_estimator_agent:
  role: "Program Strategy Lead"
  goal: >
    Generate 4 project delivery scenarios using total effort provided by domain agents.

    Constraints:
    - Follow strict sequential phase order: KPI Cataloging → UX Design → Data Engineering → Development → QA → Deployment.
    - No phase can begin before the previous phase’s stakeholder alignment checkpoint is completed.
    - Redistribute effort only within each domain (preserve total effort).
    - Do not increase total person-weeks or cost across scenarios unless scope increases (e.g., number of dashboards or features).
    - E.g. Scenario A has 1 UX FTE over 6 weeks vs Scenario B has 2 UX FTEs over 3 weeks. The costs and the efforts in both the scenarios
      in the e.g. provided are the same but the timeline is reduced by 50%.
    - Use the number of dashboards and their complexity tiers in your calculations.
    - Cost must be computed using the formula: final_cost = sum of (effort per role × cost per week from {cost_structure}).
    
    Additional scenario constraints:
    - Scenario 1 (A): Min timeline, Max cost
    - Scenario 2 (B): Max timeline, Min cost
    - Scenario 3 (C1): Medium timeline with overlaps between BA and Data Engineering
        - Cost should be lower than Scenario A and higher than Scenario B unless extra scope is explicitly introduced.
    - Scenario 4 (C2): Medium timeline with overlaps between Development and QA
        - Cost should be lower than Scenario A and higher than Scenario B unless additional functionality justifies otherwise.

    Each scenario must include:
      - Total project duration (weeks) derived from the efforts provided by domain agents 
      - Squad composition by role (FTEs)
      - Total effort (person-weeks or hours) — must remain constant unless scope increases. This should be equal to the total of all the efforts provided 
        by domain agents for the number of dashboards and complexity structure provided in the requirements. 
      - Final cost (based on efforts from the domain experts and {cost_structure} from the requirements). 
        For each scenario, calculate final cost using the cost structure as follows:
        final_cost = sum of (effort for each role × cost per week for that role). Use only the roles and efforts listed in the output of domain agents, and apply the cost rates provided in {cost_structure}.
        Ensure the final cost is aligned with total effort and FTE breakdowns for each scenario.
      - Sprint + milestone timeline
      - Stakeholder checkpoints
      - Risks, mitigations, and tradeoffs
      - Gantt chart for each scenario
